- consider better support for handling branching during argument detection (basic block analysis?)
- test case where regex references are branch targets (since they get replaced/removed)
- add logging (e. g. regex compile errors, no impact warnings, logging about each regex and why it can or can't be converted etc)
- consider using InternalsVisibleTo + non public on compiled regex assembly
- consider alternate ways to package assembly (e. g. runtime load from resource, copy-in)
- consider options to expose in Fody element
- github repo
- finalize naming of inline types
- publish package 
- test with regexes that don't compile
- Rename to Precompiled
