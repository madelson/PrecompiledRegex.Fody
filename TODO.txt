- consider better support for handling branching during argument detection (basic block analysis?)
- test case where regex references are branch targets (since they get replaced/removed)
- consider exposing alternate ways to package assembly (e. g. keeping separate)
- github repo
- readme
- finalize naming of inline types (pick one naming convention for new types instead of two... should we give the temp assembly a temp name?)
- publish package
- consider adding generatedcodeattribute to generated types
