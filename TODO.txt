- consider better support for handling branching during argument detection (basic block analysis?)
- consider exposing alternate ways to package assembly (e. g. keeping separate)
- github repo
- readme
- publish package (fix target framework)
- consider adding generatedcodeattribute to generated types
- remove extra CheckTimeout calls from Go() (probably not necessary since it internally only checks 1/1000 times)
- consider breaking compiles regexes into smaller methods for faster startup
- see if we're using sequence points incorrectly (see https://github.com/Fody/Fody/issues/102)
- see if we can improve debugging experience (again, see https://github.com/Fody/Fody/issues/102)
