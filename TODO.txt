- consider better support for handling branching during argument detection (basic block analysis?)
- consider exposing alternate ways to package assembly (e. g. keeping separate)
- github repo
- readme
- publish package (fix target framework)
- consider adding generatedcodeattribute to generated types
- remove extra CheckTimeout calls from Go() (probably not necessary since it internally only checks 1/1000 times)
